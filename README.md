# Social Media

## Description

This is a social media app that allows users to create an account, post, and comment. The app is built using MongoDB and Express.js. Creating this small version of a social media application, I learned how a well organized backend can help maintain easy to read code structure and organization. This was a great project to strengthen my ability to use Schema and Models and embedded documents within MongoDB. I enjoyed the trouble shooting aspects at the end and learning to figure out how to display the data I wanted to display. It was very satisfying to create a diverse set of data retrieval functions and see them all work intertwined!

## Installation

The first steps in installation are:
- clone the repo from github: https://github.com/TamasPinter/socialMedia
- run npm install in the terminal to install all the dependencies
- run npm start to start the server

## Usage

Using the app is fairly straight forward. Within the repo you can find the conrollers with all the paths declared. Working together with the routes js files you can find the paths to operating all the functions of the app. You can view all the users, find a singular user by ID, create a new user, update a user by ID, delete a user by ID, and also create friendships by linking two users together. Please see the attached video for a demonstration:

Next, you can access the Thoughts and Reactions portion of the app. Here you can view all thoughts, find a singular thought by ID, create a new thought (much like a social media post), update a thought by ID, delete a thought by ID, and also create reactions to thoughts. These are done by posting a reaction to a thought. Please see the attached video for a demonstration:
